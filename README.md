# SubjectToChange

This repository only contains a brief readme pointing to the actual repository and the webgl build of the project. The purpose of this repository is so those who are interested in my github and projects have a link to it.

I won't go into much detail here as there is more information in the repository I will be linking below, but a brief synopsis is appropriate. Subject to Change is a 2.5d platformer game designed over the course of my final semester as an undergraduate computer science student. It was a group project, which is why its repository is not owned by me, but instead, by one of my group members. I chose not to fork the project because the size of the repository is too large to store without purchasing lfs storage.

The game's main premise is the player has the ability to time travel, and uses this to travel betweent the past and present. The name Subject to Change is a play on this idea; the present is subject to change based on what the player does in the past. The game was built using Unity.

To learn more, vist the project's home repository [here](https://github.com/Subject-to-Change/490-Project).

To play the game, visit [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/subjecttochangewebglbuild). Do note that the project was not built with webgl as the target platform. As a result, some things do not work well with webgl, such as point lights.
